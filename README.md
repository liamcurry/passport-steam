# Passport-Google

[Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) strategy for authenticating
with [Google](http://www.google.com/) using OpenID 2.0.

## Installation

    $ npm install passport-google

## Usage

#### Configure Strategy

The Google authentication strategy authenticates users using a Google account,
which is also an OpenID 2.0 identifier.  The strategy requires a `validate`
callback, which accepts this identifier and calls `done` providing a user.
Additionally, options can be supplied to specify a return URL and realm.

    passport.use(new GoogleStrategy({
        returnURL: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/google/return',
        realm: 'http://localhost:3000/'
      },
      function(identifier, done) {
        User.findByOpenID({ openId: identifier }, function (err, user) {
          return done(err, user);
        });
      }
    ));

#### Authenticate Requests

Use `passport.authenticate()`, specifying the `'google'` strategy, to
authenticate requests.

For example, as route middleware in an [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
application:

    app.get('/auth/google',
      passport.authenticate('google'),
      function(req, res){
        // The request will be redirected to Google for authentication, so
        // this function will not be called.
      });

    app.get('/auth/google/callback', 
      passport.authenticate('google', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
      function(req, res) {
        // Successful authentication, redirect home.
        res.redirect('/');
      });
